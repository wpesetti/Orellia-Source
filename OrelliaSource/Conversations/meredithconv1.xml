Before you tell me, I heard about your rite. I know the priestess set you up.</text><line id="4" speaker="player"><text>How do you know?</text><line id="5" speaker="npc"><text>Come on, she has had it out for you ever since you were born. She says, &quot;Vasherie, you are terrible example of what a shaman's daughter should be&quot;.And then once your father comes around she's on her knees saying &quot;Vasherie, I am so very proud of how exceptionally talented you are.&quot;</text><line id="6" speaker="player"><text>But do you have any proof?</text><line id="7" speaker="npc"><text>No, but anyone with a head on their shoulders will know she sabotaged it.</text><line id="8" speaker="player"><text>I can't prove that to my father.</text><line id="9" speaker="npc"><text>Then find evidence! Go into her house and look around. See if she has anything incriminating.</text><line id="10" speaker="player"><text>Merideth, thats terrible!</text><line id="11" speaker="npc"><text>Suit yourself.</text><line id="12" speaker="player"><text>No, wait. I want to do it.</text><line id="28" speaker="npc"><text>Go then to the house where she is standing. Be sure to sneak by her when you go in.</text></line></line><line id="16" speaker="player"><text>I'll talk to you later.</text></line></line></line><line id="14" speaker="player"><text>Merideth, that's brilliant!</text><line id="15" speaker="npc"><text>Go then to the house where she is standing. Be sure to sneak by her when you go in.</text></line></line></line></line></line></line></line></line><line id="17" speaker="player"><text>She told everyone I cried during my rite, and that she had to drag me back down here.</text><line id="18" speaker="npc"><text>That's a lie! You have always been mature. I've only been out of the forest once, yet they made me an adult two years before you!</text><line id="19" speaker="player"><text>How do I prove that she has sabotaged my rite?</text><line id="20" speaker="npc"><text>Find evidence! Go into her house and look around. See if she has anything incriminating.</text><line id="21" speaker="player"><text>Meredith, that's terrible!</text><line id="22" speaker="npc"><text>Suit yourself</text><line id="23" speaker="player"><text>No, wait.

Be sure to sneak by her when you go in.</text></line></line><line id="34" speaker="player"><text>No</text><line id="35" speaker="npc"><text>Make up your mind.</text></line></line></line><line id="36" speaker="npc"><text>Im worried. The Almighty controls the followers. We were told as young children that the Almighty cared and treasured us. This should not be happening. Has your father told you anything?</text><line id="38" speaker="player"><text>He has left me in the dark.</text><line id="39" speaker="npc"><text>Vasherie, I like living. I like dancing in the moonlight and describing it in vivid detail until the High Priestess gets red in the face. I'll miss you and I'll miss the way this village lights up and comes alive each night.  I want to know why our village will be destroyed. I can't just stand here and wait!</text><line id="40" speaker="player"><text>I can't wait anymore, either.</text><line id="41" speaker="npc"><text>Let's go. This sounds crazy but we could talk to the Almighty. Ask her why and plead for it all to stop! If we're careful and if we tread lightly, we could do it. We can't just sit here and wait for death to come knocking.</text><line id="42" speaker="player"><text>We need to save the village.</text><line id="43" speaker="npc"><text>I have forgotten something. My sister, she needs medicine every few hours. How did I get so ahead of myself? I cannot do it. I owe her my protection. She has no one else.</text><line id="44" speaker="player"><text>I can go on my own.</text><line id="45" speaker="npc"><text>Talk to Warrior Shen. He knows how to get out of the village. Vasherie, stay in the shadows and prove the high priestess wrong. Don't you dare get hurt, okay? I wish I could go with you, but I believe you can do it. Tell me what the Almighty thinks of me when you get back.</text></line></line></line></line></line></line><line id="47" speaker="player"><text>I'll miss you too, Meredith.</text><line id="48" speaker="npc"><text>We can't let that happen!
